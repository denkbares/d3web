	added some fault tolerance + logging + events
		de.d3web.persistence.warnings
		KBLoader implements WarningNotifier
		when there is a child diagnosis/qcontainer/question id present
		 but no matching diagnosis/qcontainer/question declared,
		 then Logger logs a warning, and all subscribed WarningListeners are informed
		 and the Diagnosis/QContainer/Question is ignored
		why?
			one may make ignorable errors when editing the knowledgebase manually
			now these errors may not break the parsing process with an exception
			(and these errors will disappear with the next loading/saving)

	  now, nested additional contitions (e.g. temporal ones) will be loaded correctly

build_20050901_0855 georg
	* added some robustness to JarExtractor and URLUtils
	* added a LinkedListCodec: a LinkedList, which only contains objects that
	  have an appropriate codec (e.g. String, Double, Integer, Boolean, ...), can 
	  now be used as a persistent property for knowledge bases. However, up to
	  now, it cannot be used as a persistent property for CaseObject, because
	  an appropriate SAX-reader/writer does not exist yet.

build_20050819_1500 pkluegl
	* made URLUtils.getFile() more tolerant for weird urls

	speed-up in KBLoader: 
		* "search"-method faster due to changes in the order of hashtables which are to search
