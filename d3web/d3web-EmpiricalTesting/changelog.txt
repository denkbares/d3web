build_20090911_0255 furth
	* removed unused imports

build_20090908_0720 joba
    * added more features to InterviewBot (e.g., forbidden answers, known answers)
    * factory method for Finding
    * a refined strategy for StateRating and ScoreRating

build_20090906_1345 furth
	* added ability to handle XCL Knowledge
	* fixed bug concerning QuestionMC, now more than one answer can be given to a QuestionMC

build_20090827_1950 joba
    * Added InterviewBot; DDBot2 is deprecated now
      InterviewBot allows for psMethod independent generation of test cases 
      and has multiple config settings
    * refactored some methods in the persistence of sequential test cases
   
build_20090825_1740 furth
	* introduced InterviewCalculator
	* refactored caseConverter package
	  Now the converting functionality is stored in an abstract class and the
	  specific output functionality is implemented in the derived calculators.
	* a lot of JavaDoc
	* fixed wrong precision calculation in DerivedSolutionsCalculator

build_20090803_1800 furth
	* added possibility to calculate various precisions and recalls
	* some minor fixes and refactoring
	* added some java-doc

build_20090718_1215 furth
	* some minor fixes concerning state ratings, numeric answers and spaces in filepaths
	* added CaseObjectToTestsuiteConverter
		
build_20090701_2105 furth
	* derived solutions now get a staterating if all expected solutions have stateratings

build_20090625_1205 furth
	* changed visibilty of StateRating constructor to public

build_20090529_1930 joba
   * finished an initial version of a case converter

build_20090529_1700 joba
   * started with case converter

build_20090528_1330 joba
	* added some demo methods in EmpiricalTester

build_20090527_1505 joba
    * modified the starter examples of EmpiricalTester a little bit 

build_20090510_1915 ochlast
	* DDNet Visualisation: Expected AND derived solutions are now shown in erroneous testcases

build_20090428_0915 ochlast
	* introduced the new interface RatingSimilarity (to compare two Ratings) and its 
	  default implementation, the IndividualSimilariry (simple test of equality).

build_20090423_1205 ochlast
	* minor improvements (mostly in DDBuilder)

build_20090415_2230 ochlast
	* missed some files while committing
	
build_20090415_2225 ochlast
	* moved the DOT-File generating components to DDBuilder
	* new method in DDBuilder: generateDDNetAndPrintDOT(TestSuite TS, String dotFile)
	  generates the DDNet Representation of the TestSuite and prints the DOT-Tree to File
	* new option: partitionTree (see config.properties)
	* new option: compareOnlySymbolicStates (see config.properties)
	* some minor changes
	* example usage of the AdvancedEmpiricalTester in EmpiricalTester.java

build_20090402_1837 ochlast
	* no real changes, just synchronizing my laptop and desktop pc ;-)

build_20090330_1200 ochlast
	* The derived Solutions of a Rated Test Case are now hold in the Rated Test Case itself,
	  and not in a separate List. Therefore, the class TestResult was obsolete and has been removed.
	* The Test Cases are now hold in a "TestSuite", which loads the List of SequentialTestCases, 
	  checks for consistency and derives all the solutions automatically.
	* The DDNet Builder now consumes a TestSuite (instead of two List of SequentialTestCases)

build_20090326_0732 ochlast
	* some structural changes on the TestCase-holding classes TestResult and TestSuite
	* equals() and hashCode() for Findings and RatedSolutions, 
	  so that the TestCaseComparator works now and that the DDTree will be correctly written 
	  (new cases green, old cases grey)
	* EmpiricalPersistency.writeCases() now prints correctly indented XML
	* moved DDEdge & DDNode (formally known as RTCEdge & RTCNode) to package empiricalTesting.ddTrees

build_20090310_1400 ochlast
	* initial check-in of project 'EmpiricalTester'
	* basic functionality like 'Load/Save of Sequential Test Cases'
	  and computing of precision/recall is already implemented
	  - more to come...

build_20090317_1950 ochlast
	* some visual improvements
