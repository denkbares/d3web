build_3_3 alexander
02-12-10 15:05
	organized imports
	static methods are called statically

build_3_2 alexander
02-11-26 17:30
	added changelog.txt
	added AbnormalityNum
	added Abnormality hierarchie:
		AbstractAbnormality implements KnowledgeSlice
			-> Abnormality extends AbstractAbnormality
			-> AbnormalityNum extends AbstractAbnormality
				-> AbnormalityInterval (inner class)
				-> AbnormalityIntervalException (inner class)
	fixed Abnormality:
		A7 -> A5
		captured null argument in setQuestion(Question)
		! removed AnswerChoice casting from Abnormality.getXMLString()
			yes - we do know that only QuestionChoices can have Abnormalities but a cast in getXMLString??
			one day we'll have templates and then the Abnormality will get templated with Question classes
	changed SharedPersistenceHandler.SHARED_... to static
	changed SharedPersistenceWriter to use above field
	changed SharedKnowledgeLoader to create AbnormalityNum when encountering QuestionNum
	added de.d3web.kernel.shared.tests package
		-> if there are any shared knowledge tests anywhere - PLEASE move them to this package
