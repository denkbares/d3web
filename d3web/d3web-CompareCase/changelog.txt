build_20061020_1355 hesselbach & marty
	* adapted JUNIT_HOME_SRC path in classpath

build_20060629_1530 jueb
	* removed unnecessary imports, casts and instanceof-tests
	* deleted never read local variables
	* replaced deprecated method-calls

build_20050520_1500 bates
	* made case comparison independent from CaseRepositoryManager.

build_20041125_1115 bates
	* extracted CaseLoader-Classes and CaseRepository to d3web-Utilities

build_20040429_1125 marty
	* minor code cleanup
	* removed some unnecessary casts
	
build_20040305_1846 bates, marty
	* minor bugfix

build_20040305_1834 bates
	* minor bigfix

build_20040305_1622 marty, bates
	* fixed handling of unknown/missing values in CaseComparator;
	now, this corresponds to the behavior described in the dissertation
	of Klaus Goos, i.e., it corresponds to the behavior of classic D3.
	Formerly, if a value in one case was missing/unknown, and the value was
	known in the other compare-case, then a default similarity of 0.1 was
	added to the reachedPoints.
	Now, reachedPoints += 0, but the effect of unknown/missing values is reduced,
	because the weight which is added to maxPoints is multiplied by an unknown-factor,
	e.g., 0.1. Then maxPoints += rawWeight * unknown-factor.

build_20040302_1752 bates
	* fixed another ClassCastException in CaseComparator
	* hope, all List/HashSet - problems are fixed now!

build_20040213_1144 bates
	* fixed ClassCastException in CaseComparator

build_20032511_1545 chris
	* adapted to kernel changes
	
build_20031029_1322 bates
	* changes due to KnowledgeBase reference in CaseObjectImpl

build_20031025_1750 georg
	* DefaultXMLCaseLoader provides adding additional AbstractTagReaders (new method
	  "addTagReader(..)").

build_20031023_1745 georg
	* DefaultXMLCaseLoader is renamed to DomXMLCaseLoader (for old case-format)
	* now, the DefaultXMLCaseLoader uses sax.CaseObjectListCreator (new case-format)

build_20031016_1345 bates
	* changed BOTH_FILL_UNKNOWN handling in case comparison: 
	  Questions in stored case without or with unknown answers will be excluded now.

build_20031015_2221 bates
	* another change due to bugfix in case comparison

build_20031015_1405 marty
	* bugs in computing the similarity of a case fixed

build_20031014_1345 bates
	* changes due to caseRepository-refactoring

build_20031007_1148 marty:
	* rename method calculateSimilarityForClustering to
	calculateSimilarityBetweenCases

	* removed todo tags (acknowleged georgs changes)

build_20031003_1330 georg
	* changes due to caserepository-changes

build_20030926_1240 bates
	* changes due to kernel refactoring

build_20030924_1320 bates
	* changed CaseRepository: It is now the only repository for holding 
	  CaseObjects by KnowledgeBase-ids
	* Fixed clustering: works with case-ids now! (needs less memory)

build_20030920_1710 bates
	* finished clustering with tests

build_20030920_1614 bates
	* added clustering for CBR

build_20030913_2009 bates
	* added an accelerated case-comparison-mechanism for clustering

build_20030913_1832 bates
	* removed everything that had to do with "StaticCase" ;-)

build_20030606_2300 georg
	changes due to supportknowledge refactoring

build_20030512_1535 georg
	* CaseRepository uses CaseObject's now (instead of StaticCase's)

build_20030315_1520
	* bates: initial commit
