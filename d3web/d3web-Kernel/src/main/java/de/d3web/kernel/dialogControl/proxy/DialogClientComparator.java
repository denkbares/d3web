/**
 * Compares its two arguments for order.  Returns a negative integer,
 * zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal
 * to, or greater than the second.<p>
 *
 * The implementor must ensure that <tt>sgn(compare(x, y)) ==
 * -sgn(compare(y, x))</tt> for all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  (This
 * implies that <tt>compare(x, y)</tt> must throw an exception if and only
 * if <tt>compare(y, x)</tt> throws an exception.)<p>
 *
 * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
 * <tt>((compare(x, y)&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (compare(y, z)&gt;0))</tt> implies
 * <tt>compare(x, z)&gt;0</tt>.<p>
 *
 * Finally, the implementer must ensure that <tt>compare(x, y)==0</tt>
 * implies that <tt>sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z))</tt> for all
 * <tt>z</tt>.<p>
 *
 * It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that 
 * <tt>(compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</tt>.  Generally speaking,
 * any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate
 * this fact.  The recommended language is "Note: this comparator
 * imposes orderings that are inconsistent with equals."
 * 
 * @return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the
 * 	       first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the
 *	       second. 
 * @throws ClassCastException if the arguments' types prevent them from
 * 	       being compared by this Comparator.
